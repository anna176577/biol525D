## OBTAINING ALL THE FILES ON THIS SITE

To access the course content offline, you may download an up-to-date
snapshot archive of the site content from this location:
https://github.com/owensgl/biol525D/archive/master.zip

    git clone https://github.com/owensgl/biol525D.git

If the course content changes, you can update your local copy by going into to the **biol525D** directory that was created by the previous command and invoking the command:

    git pull
